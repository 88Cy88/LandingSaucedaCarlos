	<p align="center">In addition to my studies, I play video games in my free time. I have played so many different categories of video games that I have developed a taste for one genre in particular, the "Roughlike" ones. </p>
	<p align="center">Roughlike is a sub-genre of role-playing video games characterized by a maze-like adventure through randomly generated levels. </p>
	<p align="center">The list of the last Roughlike games I have played are:
	<br> &#x2022 The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth 
	<br> &#x2022 Enter the Gungeon
	</p>
	
	<h2 align="center">The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth </h2>
	<p align="center">
		The Binding of Isaac is a game where the character must use his own tears as bullets, functioning similar to a shooting game. Using a gameplay style inspired by Smash TV, Isaac is a twin-stick video game: one stick is used to walk while shooting using the other stick instead of using buttons. The player is required to explore through randomly generated dungeons in many matches to achieve various objectives with multiple characters, with the dungeon structure inspired by the first Legend of Zelda. While the character has stats and can be upgraded, the game does not have a level and experience based gameplay system, but instead uses a system based on items that can be found throughout the game to improve stats.

	<h2 align="center">Enter the Gungeon</h2>
	<p align="center">
		Enter the Gungeon is a shoot-em-up dungeon crawler that follows a band of misfits as they shoot, loot, roll and turn tables in search of the legendary treasure of the Gungeon: the weapon that can kill the past. Select a hero and fight your way deep into the Dungeon, surviving ever-developing challenges filled with adorably dangerous armies and fearsome bosses armed to the teeth. Gather precious loot, uncover hidden secrets and converse with opportunistic merchants to obtain powerful items and kill your past.
